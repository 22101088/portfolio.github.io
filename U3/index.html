I 
am a person who is positive about every aspect of life.<br />
There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience.<br />
I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to 
talk, I like to listen.<br />
I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; 
I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming 
from the ocean.<br />
I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought 
experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.<br />
I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter.<br />
I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be 
surrounded by people.<br />
I like countrys peace, I like metropolis noise; I like the beautiful west lake 
in Hangzhou, I like the flat cornfield in Champaign.<br />
I like delicious food and comfortable shoes; I like good books and romantic 
movies. I like the land and the nature, I like people. And, I like to laugh.</p>
