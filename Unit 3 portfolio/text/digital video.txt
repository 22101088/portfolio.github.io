Digital video is audio/visual content in a binary format, with information is presented as a sequence of digital data rather than in a continuous signal as analog information is.
Digital video can be stored on digital media such as Blu-ray Disc, on computer data storage, or streamed over the Internet to end users who watch content on a desktop computer screen or a digital smart TV.
